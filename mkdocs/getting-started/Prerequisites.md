|     RAM    |         2GB         |                                           The more players, plugins you have requires<br>more RAM to be installed to the server                                           |
| Disk Space |       Variable      | Minecraft server's do not use much disk<br>space. Bare in mind that bigger worlds use<br>more disk space, as do plugins and <br>player data. An SSD is also recommended  |
